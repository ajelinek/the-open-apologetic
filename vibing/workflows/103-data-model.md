# Workflow: 103 - Data Model Generation

**Objective**: Create the `D03 - Data Model.md` document that details the persisted data model, including entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints. This focuses solely on the data structure and relationships independent of access patterns or user experience.

## Required Inputs

**MUST STOP** if any required information is missing. Ask for clarification before proceeding.

## Validation Questions

1. **Core Business Entities**: What are the main business entities that need to be stored (users, projects, orders, etc.)?
2. **Entity Relationships**: How do these entities relate to each other (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)?
3. **Data Attributes**: What specific attributes does each entity need (name, email, status, dates, etc.)?
4. **Business Rules**: What are the business rules and constraints for each entity (required fields, value ranges, uniqueness)?
5. **Sensitive Data**: What data is considered sensitive and requires special protection?
6. **Audit Requirements**: Do you need to track who changed what data and when?
7. **Compliance Requirements**: Are there specific compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?

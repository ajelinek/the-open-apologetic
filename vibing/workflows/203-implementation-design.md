# Workflow: 203 - Implementation Design Generation

**Objective**: Create detailed technical implementation specifications that define specific code changes, types, functions, and design approaches required to satisfy feature requirements and test scenarios while ensuring architectural consistency and code quality.

## Required Inputs

**MUST STOP** if any required information is missing. Ask for clarification before proceeding.

- Specific feature ID/name from Feature Overview document

## Validation Questions

1. **Feature Context**: What specific feature is being designed for implementation?
2. **Architecture Alignment**: How does this feature align with existing system architecture?
3. **Integration Points**: What are the key integration points with existing components?
4. **Data Requirements**: What data model changes or new data access patterns are needed?
5. **API Requirements**: What new API endpoints or modifications are required?
6. **UI Components**: What new UI components or modifications are needed?

## Execute Checklist

**Component Definition**

- [ ] **Frontend**: Define new UI components and state management requirements
- [ ] **Backend**: Define new API endpoints and business logic requirements
- [ ] **Data**: Define schema changes and data access patterns

**Content Creation**

- [ ] Use @vibing/templates/T11c - Implementation Design.md structure
- [ ] **ONLY populate sections 2.5 and 3-6**: Component Architecture diagrams, Frontend Change Summary Table, Backend Change Summary Table, Frontend Implementation Details, and Backend Implementation Details
- [ ] **Read existing sections 1-2 and 7** from the file (Feature Overview, User Journey, and Test Scenarios)
- [ ] **Leave sections 1-2 and 7 unchanged** - do not modify Feature Overview, User Journey, or Test Scenarios
- [ ] Create Frontend Component Dependencies diagram (section 2.5.1) showing relationships between components, hooks, and modules with status annotations
- [ ] Create Frontend State Flow diagram (section 2.5.2) showing state management structure, actions, and state transitions - stop at backend boundary, show API calls and returns but not backend internals
- [ ] Create Backend Module Dependencies diagram (section 2.5.3) showing relationships between API handlers, services, and data access layers
- [ ] Populate Frontend Change Summary Table (section 3) with all required frontend modifications
- [ ] Populate Backend Change Summary Table (section 4) with all required backend modifications
- [ ] Populate Frontend Implementation Details (section 5) for all items in Frontend Change Summary Table **EXCEPT** style modules (CSS, SCSS, style files) which should be listed in the summary table but not detailed here
- [ ] Populate Backend Implementation Details (section 6) for all items in Backend Change Summary Table
- [ ] For each module/file title, include status indicator: `🟢 NEW`, `🟡 UPDATED`, or `⚪ EXISTING` (e.g., `### 🟡 UPDATED: [path/to/module.ts]`)
- [ ] For each module/file, provide a Module Description explaining its purpose
- [ ] For UPDATED modules, focus Module Description on what is changing and why, not on core functionality
- [ ] For each function/component, use interface signature as heading: `functionName(params: Type) => ReturnType`
- [ ] Include Purpose and Constraints for each function/component
- [ ] For UPDATED functions/components, focus Purpose on what is changing and why, not on core functionality
- [ ] Include Implementation Details only for complex scenarios and business rules
- [ ] Ensure all test scenarios are addressed in implementation details

**Architecture Validation**

- [ ] Ensure no duplication of existing functionality across all layers
- [ ] Verify all implementation decisions align with established architecture
- [ ] Ensure no code duplication across system components
- [ ] Validate implementation supports future expansion requirements
- [ ] Confirm clean patterns and maintainable code structure
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive error handling and testing coverage
- [ ] All integration points properly designed and documented
- [ ] **Architectural Consistency**: All implementations align with established patterns
- [ ] **Future Expansion**: Design supports future feature requirements
- [ ] **Clean Patterns**: Follow established coding standards and maintainability principles
- [ ] **Integration Validation**: All cross-component integration points are properly designed
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive testing strategy for all implementation components

**Quality Assurance**

- [ ] Verify Component Architecture diagrams (section 2.5) accurately reflect all components/modules from Change Summary Tables (exclude style modules from diagrams)
- [ ] Verify diagrams are compact and focused
- [ ] Verify Frontend Component Dependencies diagram shows all relationships and status annotations (🟢 NEW, 🟡 UPDATED, ⚪ EXISTING)
- [ ] Verify Frontend State Flow diagram shows state structure, actions, and transitions - stops at backend boundary showing API calls and returns but not backend internals
- [ ] Verify Backend Module Dependencies diagram shows service dependencies and data flow
- [ ] Verify Frontend Change Summary Table (section 3) completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Verify Backend Change Summary Table (section 4) completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Ensure implementation details focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [ ] Verify all module/file titles include status indicators (🟢 NEW, 🟡 UPDATED, ⚪ EXISTING)

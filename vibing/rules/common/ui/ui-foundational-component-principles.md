Foundational components are the building blocks of the application, used across the application. They should be consistent and reusable and are stored in components/foundation.

# Foundational Components

- Leverage foundation components as building blocks
- Ensure consistency, composability, and use of foundational building blocks
- Keep components small and single purpose
- Single module per component
- Full accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first design
- Type-safe interfaces
- Consistent API patterns

# Example Foundational Components

- Alert (notifications, errors)
- Button (actions)
- Dialog (modals, popups)
- Dropdown (selection menus)
- Icon (wrapped SVG components)
- Input (form fields)
- List (data display)
- Loading (spinners, skeletons)
- Table (data grids)

## Component Properties

- Must extend BaseProps interface
- Consistent variant patterns
- CSS module classes

# HTML Semantic Guidelines for Testing

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of generic `<div>` with classes
- Add ARIA attributes to sections: `<section aria-label="hero">` instead of `<section class="hero">`
- Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names
- Follow all A11y practices

# Accessibility Requirements

See @vibing/rules/common/ui/ui-accessibility-guidelines.md for comprehensive accessibility standards and implementation guidelines.
